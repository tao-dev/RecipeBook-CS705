			******Khapse******
		
			Instructions:
	1. In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, eggs, one stick 
	   of melted butter and 1/2 cup of milk. Mix the ingredients
	   completely into dough.
	2. Roll dough until very thin using a rolling pin. Next, 
	   cut rolled dough into rectangular shapes, about 3 
	   inches by 1 inch. Make a second cut down the middle 
	   of the rectangular piece leaving ½ inch uncut at each end.
	3. Fold one end through the cut in the center to make
	   the traditional khapse shape.
	4. Heat oil at medium heat in a deep pan. Once oil is hot,
	   fry khapse until they turn brown.
